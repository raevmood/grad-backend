Key Benefit
EventHub’s AI Assistant allows moderators to focus on judgment and community safety while automating repetitive checks, categorization, and risk detection.
Attendee Journey: An attendee begins by logging into EventHub and accessing the home interface. 
They use semantic search powered by natural language understanding to find events, such as typing 
free yoga tomorrow” or “music nearby,” and the system interprets the request with AI-driven filters. 
Once the attendee discovers a relevant event, they can RSVP directly, receiving instant confirmation 
and a calendar invite. As the event date approaches, the platform automatically sends personalized 
reminders, including a notification 24 hours prior, ensuring the attendee is prepared and engaged.

Creator Journey: An event creator logs in and navigates to the event submission form. They input 
title, description, date, time, and optional media, while the AI assistant suggests categories, 
tags, and formatting to improve visibility. Upon submission, the event is stored in the backend 
and analyzed by an AI agent for risk and quality scoring before being queued for moderator review. 
Once approved, the event is published to the attendee-facing platform and indexed in the vector database 
for semantic discovery, enabling better reach and searchability. The creator receives immediate status 
updates via email or dashboard alerts when their event is approved or requires revision.

Moderator Journey: A moderator accesses the moderation dashboard, where pending events are displayed 
with AI-generated metadata and risk scores. The system highlights suspicious indicators such as spam-like 
language or broken links, offering reasoning for each assessment. The moderator reviews the details and 
decides to approve, reject, or flag the event for further investigation, with automated communication 
sent back to the creator. After approval, the AI continues monitoring for irregularities like sudden 
RSVP spikes or malicious edits, notifying moderators if intervention is needed. This reduces repetitive 
workload, enabling moderators to focus on community safety and ensuring only high-quality, trustworthy 
events are published.
User Rules: Users must provide accurate information during registration and maintain only one account. 
They are expected to respect community guidelines by engaging with events in a genuine and constructive way. 
Misuse of the platform, such as spamming RSVPs, posting inappropriate comments, or attempting to bypass AI 
or moderation checks, is strictly prohibited. Users must also respect other attendees’ privacy and use the 
platform for legitimate event discovery and participation only.

Organizer Rules: Organizers must create events that are truthful, relevant, and aligned with community 
standards. Event details including title, description, location, and attached links must not be misleading 
or fraudulent. Organizers must not submit duplicate events or use the platform to advertise unrelated 
products or services. They are responsible for responding promptly if moderators request clarifications 
and must honor commitments such as updating event details when changes occur. Failure to comply may lead 
to suspension of organizer privileges.

Moderator Rules: Moderators must act fairly and consistently when reviewing events, using AI-generated 
insights as support but not as the sole basis for decisions. They are expected to follow platform guidelines 
when approving, rejecting, or flagging events, and to document reasons for each action taken. Moderators must 
avoid bias or favoritism and treat all users and organizers equally. They should escalate complex or 
borderline cases instead of making arbitrary decisions, ensuring trust and transparency in the moderation 
process.
